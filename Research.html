                <hr>
                <p>My research uses genomic data to study the process of speciation and genome evolution in birds at multiple scales, from population genetics to phylogenomics. I am motivated by broad questions around how species arise, differentiate, and are maintained.

                <h2>Hybrid introgression as a pathway for adaptation</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>One of my main research themes has been around the role of introgression in the genome evolution of young species groups. Hybridization is often viewed as a hinderance to biodiversity: eroding species barriers and homogenizing populations. However, hybridization may also play a creative role in evolution by facilitating the sharing of adaptive variation between lineages and allowing for novel combinations of traits to be brought together. My research has tested for hybridization in several systems, including the seabirds of the family Stercorariidae and Amazonian manakins of the genus Lepidothrix. In both the seabirds and the manakins, I found evidence for extensive hybridization and uncovered cases of likely adaptive introgression. My research highlights how rare hybridization events can allow species complexes to share beneficial mutations with each other even as they continue on independant evolutionary trajectories.</p>

                <h2>The timeline of speciation</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>As genomic data accumulates from multiple species pairs, it allows us to begin to piece together the patterns in the timing and order of events that lead to the formation of new species. Birds provide an excellent system in which to study the timeline of speciation due to the detailed cataloguing of avian diversity over the previous centuries of ornithological research, providing an increasingly complete understanding of the avian phylogeny. This allows us to ask questions such as: 
                    What arises first, premating barriers or postmating barriers? 
                    To what degree is the evolution of reproductive isolation clock-like, and what determines how quickly the clock ticks? 
                    What is the shape of the relationship between divergence time and degree of reproductive isolation? 
                    What genomic features contribute to postzygotic reproductive isolation? 
                    To what extent is reproductive isolation driven by changes due to natural selection vs genetic drift?                 </p>

                <h2>Comparative genomics</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                The increasing ease of whole genome sequencing for non-model organisms is rapidly unlocking a wealth of data that allows us to ask questions that were not possible before. 
                My research combines publicly-available genome assemblies with de novo genome sequencing to build large comparative datasets from temperate and neotropical birds. I use these datasets to 
                ask whether rates of genome evolution vary between birds of different biomes and life history strategies. My research seeks to link broad biogeographical and phylogenetic patterns to variation in microevolutionary processes of mutation, drift, and selection to better understand the forces that shape avian genome evolution.

                <h2>Phylogenomics of the Stercorariidae</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                As the first chapter of my PhD, I focused on the phylogenomics of the family Stercorariidae, an enigmatic group of seven seabirds. 
                Previous work had found discordance between the mitochondrial phylogeny and expected species relationships, which led to hypotheses that one of the species may be of hybrid origin.
                I sequenced whole genomes from all seven species and found evidence for high levels of gene flow between species. While I ruled out the proposed case of hybrid speciation, I found that 
                the mitochondrial genome had introgressed from one species (Pomarine Jaeger) into another (Great Skua). This was accompanied by a small amount of gene flow throughout the rest of the genome.
                Notably, I found that a haplotype of the gene MC1R had introgressed into the Pomarine Jaeger: this haplotype is known to be responsible for a dark morph phenotype in the Pomarine Jaeger, introducing a colour polymorphism that is thought to be ecologically important for the Pomarine Jaeger's hunting strategy. 
                This serves as a concrete example of an adaptive trait being passed across species boundaries through rare hybridization.
